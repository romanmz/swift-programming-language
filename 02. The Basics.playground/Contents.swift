// OPTIONALS

// You can define vars to have an "optional" value by adding "?" after any type definition
let optionalConstant: Int?
var optionalVariable: Int?

// Optional constants still need to have a specific value defined, this throws an error:
// optionalConstant

// Optional variables are automatically set as nil if no value was passed
optionalVariable

// Functions can return optional values, for example the Int initializer function
let possibleNumber = "Hello world"
let convertedNumber = Int(possibleNumber)

// Optionals and non optionals are not interoperable, even if they are of the same type
let possibleNumber2 = "123"
let convertedNumber2 = Int(possibleNumber2)
// Throws an error:
// let intSum = 123 + convertedNumber2

// To check whether an optional has a value or not, you can check against nil
if convertedNumber2 == nil {
    print( "not a number" )
} else {
    // You can force "unwrap" the number by adding "!" after the variable name, but you must be 100% sure that is not nil, otherwise errors will be generated
    print( "it's the number: \( convertedNumber2! )" )
}

// You can also use "optional binding", which is trying to pass the value of the optional to another variable or constant inside an "if" or "while" statement, if the optional has a value the statement will return tru
if let actualNumber = Int(possibleNumber2) {
    print("\"\(possibleNumber2)\" has an integer value of \(actualNumber)")
} else {
    print("\"\(possibleNumber2)\" could not be converted to an integer")
}

// You can define an optional using "!" instead of "?"
// This will allow you to access the value without having to manually unwrap it
// This is called an "implicitly unwrapped optional", and they are used when it is assumed that the variable will eventually have a defined value
// It is most often used for initializing class properties
let assumedString: String! = "An implicitly unwrapped optional string."
let implicitString: String = assumedString // no need to unwrap the optional

// note that if the optional was defined as nil at some point, it will still throw errors if you try to access it
// implicitly unwrapped optionals should only ever be used when you are sure the variable will eventually get a defined value, and never go back to nil



// ERROR HANDLING
// Same as on "A swift tour"


// ASSERTIONS and PRECONDITIONS
// ------------------------------

// Assertions and preconditions check for a necessary condition, if it is not met the program stops and throws an error

// Unlike the error conditions discussed in Error Handling, assertions and preconditions arenâ€™t used for recoverable or expected errors.
// Using them to enforce valid data and state causes your app to terminate more predictably if an invalid state occurs, and helps makes the problem easier to debug

// Assertions are only checked in debug builds, preconditions are checked both in debug and production builds
// this means you can use as many assertions in your code as you want without impacting performance in production

// Use 'asert' to check for a condition
let age = 3
assert(age >= 0, "A person's age cannot be less than zero")

// or 'assertionFailure(_:file:line:)' when the check has already been made and you want to indicate that an error happened:
if age > 10 {
	"Older than 10"
} else if age > 0 {
	"Younger than 10"
} else {
	assertionFailure("Invalid age value")
}

// To use preconditions instead use the 'precondition(_:_:file:line:)' and 'preconditionFailure(_:file:line:)' functions
// Preconditions can still be ignored when compiling in 'unchecked' mode

// 'fatalError(_:file:line:)' functions always run regardless of the compiling mode
